title: International Misallocation and Comovement under Production Networks
summary: In this paper, I develop an aggregation theory for a distorted open production network economy with endogenous labor supply. I provide nonparametric formulas that decompose the country-level total factor productivity variation. These formulas account for within-country household heterogeneity, factoral reallocation between countries, and labor supply elasticity. The decompositions depend on sufficient statistics that allow me to characterize the effect on domestic real GDP from (i) firm-level productivity and distortion shocks in domestic and foreign firms and (ii) variations in the global income distributions. Additionally, these decompositions do not require measures of real variations, facilitating their empirical implementation, as price data is no longer necessary. These results support a theory of economic spillovers and contagion through industrial networks, corroborating the essential role of global value chains in creating strong complementarities and commonalities in business cycles across countries.
