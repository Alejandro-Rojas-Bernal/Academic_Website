title: Nonlinearities in Production Network Economies with Distortions
authors:
- Alejandro Rojas-Bernal
- Ali Karimirad
summary: We offer the first non-linear analysis of how microeconomic disruptions in an inefficient production network economy impact aggregate TFP. Our decompositions, applicable to any general equilibrium economy, provide non-parametric insights. We identify essential general equilibrium metrics for capturing the non-linear repercussions of microeconomic fluctuations through network connections. Our findings encompass firm-level productivity shocks, wasted distortions, and rebated distortions. We reveal that substantial shocks or high production process complementarity/substitution introduce substantial bias in the linear approximation of distortions and productivity shocks found in the literature. Our non-linear second-order effects substantially mitigate this bias.
