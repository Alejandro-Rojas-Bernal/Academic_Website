summary: Microeconomic shocks, such as sectoral disruptions, notably impact aggregate variables like GDP. However, the extent of this influence on macroeconomic factors and the role of economic structure remains a pertinent question. Hulten (1978) posits that the first-order impact of sectoral shocks on GDP within an efficient economy hinges on their sales shares. Nonetheless, the second-order impact of severe shocks can hold substantial significance and profoundly alter outcomes. Furthermore, economic inefficiencies must be considered, particularly since they transform the face of severe disruptions like the Great Recession or the COVID-19 pandemic. This study offers a resilient second-order approximation method to assess the ramifications of microeconomic shocks on GDP, encompassing shifts in frictions or sectoral shocks. Our proposed approach remains resilient despite various distortions, spanning from those that squander output to those that channel output back to households.
