summary: In this paper, we estimate how changes in the structure of global input-output networks have influenced growth. Using an open economy production network model, we identify sufficient statistics that characterize how productivity shocks across domestic and foreign firms influence country-level TFP. We estimate these sufficient statistics using data on input-output networks and sectoral productivity shocks. Structural changes in global input-output networks between 1965 and 2000 were advantageous for developing countries and unfavorable for advanced economies. Holding the global input-output network fixed, TFP growth in China and India would have been 26.6% and 9.7% lower between 1965 and 2000. Whereas for the US and Australia, TFP growth would have been 4.0% and 16.8% higher. Finally, we show that the dynamics of the domestic intermediate input cost share capture the importance that the structure of the global input-output network has on the amplification of shocks on TFP. Our analysis illustrates the importance of industrial linkages and robust domestic intermediate input markets for economic growth.
