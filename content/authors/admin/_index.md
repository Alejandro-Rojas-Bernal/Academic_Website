I am a macroeconomist working in production networks, international finance, and inequality. My job market paper explores how variations in income and consumption distributions affect aggregate misallocation and total factor productivity.  

I will join the Department of Economics at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa as an assistant professor in the Fall of 2024.
